# Problem 1: Lists, Sets and Coercion
# ----------------------------

# 1.a Create a list of integers no fewer than 10 items from 0 to 9.
one_a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# 1.b Add 3 to the 5th indexed element
one_b = one_a[5] + 3  # 5th index is value 5 -> 8

# 1.c Coerce all elements in the list to floats using list comprehension
one_c = [float(x) for x in one_a]

# 1.d Coerce the list to a set
one_d = set(one_a)

# 1.e Using a method, append int 10 to the set
_one_e_work = set(one_d)
_one_e_work.add(10)
one_e = _one_e_work

# 1.f Using a method, pop an item from the set
_one_f_work = set(one_e)
_ = _one_f_work.pop()  # value popped is arbitrary; assignment cares about the operation/result
one_f = _one_f_work  # resulting set after the pop

# 1.g Using a length counting function, count the number of items in the set
one_g = len(one_f)

# 1.h Check if the number of items in the set is the same as the number of items in the list
one_h = (len(one_f) == len(one_a))

# 1.i Coerce the set to a list and use the "+" operator to combine with list from 1.a
one_i = list(one_f) + one_a

# 1.j Coerce 1.i to a set
one_j = set(one_i)

# 1.k Count the number of elements in the 1.j

# Problem 4: Changing variable types
# For each step, modify the numeric variable and append its type to a running list.
# ----------------------------

# 4.a Create a variable of type int with the value of 8
four_a = 8

# 4.b Create an empty list (this will be our running list of types)
four_b = []

# 4.c Using type(), add the type of 4.a to this list
four_b.append(type(four_a))
four_c = four_b  # alias to show the state after this step

# 4.d Add 0.39 to the numeric variable
four_d = four_a + 0.39

# 4.e append the type of (the new numeric variable) to the list
four_b.append(type(four_d))

# 4.f exponentiate to the -10 (four_d ** -10), round to 0 decimals, and append type to list
four_f = round(four_d ** -10, 0)
four_b.append(type(four_f))

# 4.g append the type of the list itself to the list (keeps the "running" idea visible)
four_b.append(type(four_b))
four_g = four_b  # current snapshot/reference


# ----------------------------
# Problem 5: More variable type changes (continue from Problem 4)
# ----------------------------

# 5.a Manually create a dictionary where values are items in the list from Problem 4
#     and keys are their index in the list. Print the dictionary.
five_a = {i: v for i, v in enumerate(four_b)}
print(five_a)

# 5.b Add 300 and coerce it into a string
five_b = str(300)

# 5.c append the type to the list
four_b.append(type(five_b))
five_c = four_b  # snapshot

# 5.d slice the string up to the 2nd element
five_d = five_b[:2]  # "30"

# 5.e append the type to the list
four_b.append(type(five_d))
five_e = four_b  # snapshot

# 5.f use list comprehension to convert this into a new list of integers
five_f = [int(ch) for ch in five_d]  # [3, 0]

# 5.g append the type to the list
four_b.append(type(five_f))
five_g = four_b  # snapshot

# 5.h append the type of three_setA to the list
four_b.append(type(three_setA))
five_h = four_b  # final snapshot/reference of the running types list
